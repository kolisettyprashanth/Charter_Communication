### SYS_ERR_DEVICE_TIMEOUT
**Description:** The device failed to acknowledge a keep‑alive or command within the configured timeout period. 
**Likely Causes:** High CPU, network congestion, or firmware bug. 
**Recommended Actions:** 
  1. Verify device CPU %, memory, and interface statistics. 
  2. Increase timeout threshold temporarily. 
  3. Check for firmware updates.
**Related Logs:** CPU_HIGH_UTIL, INTERFACE_DOWN.

### FW_DROP_INVALID_PKT
**Description:** Stateful firewall dropped a packet that did not match existing connection table and failed RFC compliance checks. 
**Likely Causes:** Malformed packet, possible intrusion attempt, asymmetric routing. 
**Recommended Actions:** 
  1. Capture packets to validate header fields. 
  2. Confirm routing symmetry between interfaces. 
  3. Review IPS signatures.

### ROUTING_LOOP_DETECTED
**Description:** TTL expired in transit indicating a potential routing loop. 
**Likely Causes:** Incorrect route advertisements, split horizon issues. 
**Recommended Actions:** 
  1. Trace route path to locate looping nodes. 
  2. Review BGP/OSPF configurations for conflicting metrics.

### INTERFACE_DOWN
**Description:** Physical or logical interface transitioned to DOWN state. 
**Likely Causes:** Cable unplugged, admin shutdown, hardware failure. 
**Recommended Actions:** 
  1. Check physical connectivity. 
  2. Verify interface configuration. 
  3. Run diagnostics on transceivers.

### BGP_PEER_RESET
**Description:** BGP neighbor session unexpectedly reset. 
**Likely Causes:** Keep‑alive timeout, firewall blocking TCP 179, max prefix limit exceeded. 
**Recommended Actions:** 
  1. Validate neighbor timers and state. 
  2. Inspect firewall rules. 
  3. Check prefix count policies.

### CPU_HIGH_UTIL
**Description:** Device CPU utilization exceeded 90% for more than 60 seconds. 
**Likely Causes:** DDoS attack, routing process churn, insufficient hardware. 
**Recommended Actions:** 
  1. Identify top CPU processes. 
  2. Apply rate‑limiting or hardware upgrade.

### MEMORY_LEAK
**Description:** Steady increase in memory usage by a process without release. 
**Likely Causes:** Firmware bug, runaway logging. 
**Recommended Actions:** 
  1. Restart offending process. 
  2. Patch firmware.

### DHCP_IP_POOL_EXHAUSTED
**Description:** DHCP server exhausted available IP addresses for a scope. 
**Likely Causes:** Too few addresses, rogue devices. 
**Recommended Actions:** 
  1. Increase pool size. 
  2. Identify and remove rogue devices.

### TLS_HANDSHAKE_FAILURE
**Description:** TLS handshake failed due to certificate or protocol mismatch. 
**Likely Causes:** Expired certificate, cipher suite incompatibility. 
**Recommended Actions:** 
  1. Renew certificates. 
  2. Update cipher suites.

### NAT_TABLE_OVERFLOW
**Description:** NAT translation table reached max capacity, new connections dropped. 
**Likely Causes:** High connection churn, insufficient memory allocation. 
**Recommended Actions:** 
  1. Increase translation table size. 
  2. Enable connection timeout tuning.
